# CGI-Travel-App Prototype
---


This project was built using [React JS](https://reactjs.org/), [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). 
For this project I utilized the full 6 hours of time allotted. I decided to proceed with the build using all custom CSS to demonstrate my front end skill set. 

The architecture of the prototype is built around the data.js file that housed all data for the travel destinations. Utilizing React's props and hooks functionality that data is rendered within the CardList.js and Card.js components. The Details page are then dynamically rendered using the Key identifier to retrieve the specific object associated with that element. 

##### To view prototype
---
1. **Clone repo** to local machine
2. From within project folder structure **run npm install** to install all dependencies.
3. Run **npm start** to view a local version of the prototype at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)



## Final Product Development Recommendations
---

Looking at the potential expansion of this application I would first recommend utilizing a UI framework. This will improve efficiency and consistency across multiple developers. With the architecture of the application I would recommend Context, data layer, component/template structure to improve future data handling. With the current functionality I believe also shifting to a different framework like Angular might provide more component flexibility in the future.
